Support for\nContinuous Assurance lets us treat security truly as a 'state' as opposed to a 'point in time' achievement. This is particularly important in today's context when\n'continuous change' has become a norm.\nThere can be two types of drift:\n\u2711 Drift involving 'baseline' configuration: This involves settings that have a fixed number of possible states (often pre-defined/statically determined ones). For instance, a SQL DB can have TDE encryption turned ON or OFF\u05d2\u20ac\u00a6or a Storage Account may have auditing turned ON however the log retention period may be less than 365 days.\n\u2711 Drift involving 'stateful' configuration: There are settings which cannot be constrained within a finite set of well-known states. For instance, the IP addresses configured to have access to a SQL DB can be any (arbitrary) set of IP addresses. In such scenarios, usually human judgment is initially required to determine whether a particular configuration should be considered 'secure' or not. However, once that is done, it is important to ensure that there is no \"stateful drift\" from the attested configuration. (E.g., if, in a troubleshooting session, someone adds the IP address of a developer machine to the list, the Continuous Assurance feature should be able to identify the drift and generate notifications/alerts or even trigger 'auto-remediation' depending on the severity of the change).\nReference:\nhttps://azsk.azurewebsites.net/04-Continous-Assurance/Readme.html",

Contributors to the topic branch work how they want in the topic branch, and the default branches keep a linear history through the use of squash merges. The commit history of a master branch updated with squash merges will have one commit for each merged branch.

Litware has a main office and five branch offices.\n\nExisting Environment -\n\nApplication Architecture -\nThe company's primary application is a single monolithic retirement fund management system based on ASP.NET web forms that use logic written in VB.NET.\nSome new sections of the application are written in C#.\nVariations of the application are created for individual customers. Currently, there are more than 80 live code branches in the application's code base.\nThe application was developed by using Microsoft Visual Studio. Source code is stored in Team Foundation Server (TFS) in the main office. The branch offices access the source code by using TFS proxy servers.\n\nArchitectural Issues -\nLitware focuses on writing new code for customers. No resources are provided to refactor or remove existing code. Changes to the code base take a long time, as dependencies are not obvious to individual developers.\nMerge operations of the code often take months and involve many developers. Code merging frequently introduces bugs that are difficult to locate and resolve.\nCustomers report that ownership costs of the retirement fund management system increase continually. The need to merge unrelated code makes even minor code changes expensive.\nCustomers report that bug reporting is overly complex.\n\nRequirements -\n\nPlanned Changes -\nLitware plans to develop a new suite of applications for investment planning. The investment planning applications will require only minor integration with the existing retirement fund management system.\nThe investment planning applications suite will include one multi-tier web application and two iOS mobile applications. One mobile application will be used by employees; the other will be used by customers.\nLitware plans to move to a more agile development methodology. Shared code will be extracted into a series of packages.\nLitware has started an internal cloud transformation process and plans to use cloud-based services whenever suitable.\nLitware wants to become proactive in detecting failures, rather than always waiting for customer bug reports.\n\nTechnical Requirements -\nThe company's investment planning applications suite must meet the following technical requirements:\nNew incoming connections through the firewall must be minimized.\nMembers of a group named Developers must be able to install packages.\nThe principle of least privilege must be used for all permission assignments.\nA branching strategy that supports developing new functionality in isolation must be used.\nMembers of a group named Team Leaders must be able to create new packages and edit the permissions of package feeds.\nVisual Studio App Center must be used to centralize the reporting of mobile application crashes and device types in use.\nBy default, all releases must remain available for 30 days, except for production releases, which must be kept for 60 days.\nCode quality and release quality are critical. During release, deployments must not proceed between stages if any active bugs are logged against the release.\nThe mobile applications must be able to call the share pricing service of the existing retirement fund management system. Until the system is upgraded, the service will only support basic authentication over HTTPS.\nThe required operating system configuration for the test servers changes weekly. Azure Automation State Configuration must be used to ensure that the operating system on each test server is configured the same way when the servers are created and checked periodically.\n\nCurrent Technical Issue -\nThe test servers are configured correctly when first deployed, but they experience configuration drift over time. Azure Automation State Configuration fails to correct the configurations.\nAzure Automation State Configuration nodes are registered by using the following command.\nQuestion\nHOTSPOT -\nHow should you complete the code to initialize App Center in the mobile application? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.\nNOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.\nHot Area:",

Litware has a main office and five branch offices.\n\nExisting Environment -\n\nApplication Architecture -\nThe company's primary application is a single monolithic retirement fund management system based on ASP.NET web forms that use logic written in VB.NET.\nSome new sections of the application are written in C#.\nVariations of the application are created for individual customers. Currently, there are more than 80 live code branches in the application's code base.\nThe application was developed by using Microsoft Visual Studio. Source code is stored in Team Foundation Server (TFS) in the main office. The branch offices access the source code by using TFS proxy servers.\n\nArchitectural Issues -\nLitware focuses on writing new code for customers. No resources are provided to refactor or remove existing code. Changes to the code base take a long time, as dependencies are not obvious to individual developers.\nMerge operations of the code often take months and involve many developers. Code merging frequently introduces bugs that are difficult to locate and resolve.\nCustomers report that ownership costs of the retirement fund management system increase continually. The need to merge unrelated code makes even minor code changes expensive.\nCustomers report that bug reporting is overly complex.\n\nRequirements -\n\nPlanned Changes -\nLitware plans to develop a new suite of applications for investment planning. The investment planning applications will require only minor integration with the existing retirement fund management system.\nThe investment planning applications suite will include one multi-tier web application and two iOS mobile applications. One mobile application will be used by employees; the other will be used by customers.\nLitware plans to move to a more agile development methodology. Shared code will be extracted into a series of packages.\nLitware has started an internal cloud transformation process and plans to use cloud-based services whenever suitable.\nLitware wants to become proactive in detecting failures, rather than always waiting for customer bug reports.\n\nTechnical Requirements -\nThe company's investment planning applications suite must meet the following technical requirements:\nNew incoming connections through the firewall must be minimized.\nMembers of a group named Developers must be able to install packages.\nThe principle of least privilege must be used for all permission assignments.\nA branching strategy that supports developing new functionality in isolation must be used.\nMembers of a group named Team Leaders must be able to create new packages and edit the permissions of package feeds.\nVisual Studio App Center must be used to centralize the reporting of mobile application crashes and device types in use.\nBy default, all releases must remain available for 30 days, except for production releases, which must be kept for 60 days.\nCode quality and release quality are critical. During release, deployments must not proceed between stages if any active bugs are logged against the release.\nThe mobile applications must be able to call the share pricing service of the existing retirement fund management system. Until the system is upgraded, the service will only support basic authentication over HTTPS.\nThe required operating system configuration for the test servers changes weekly. Azure Automation State Configuration must be used to ensure that the operating system on each test server is configured the same way when the servers are created and checked periodically.\n\nCurrent Technical Issue -\nThe test servers are configured correctly when first deployed, but they experience configuration drift over time. Azure Automation State Configuration fails to correct the configurations.\nAzure Automation State Configuration nodes are registered by using the following command.\nQuestion\nHOTSPOT -\nHow should you configure the release retention policy for the investment planning depletions suite?

        "descriptionIs": "The commit history of the POC branch must replace the history of the default branch.\nRebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. Rebasing is most useful and easily visualized in the context of a feature branching workflow. The general process can be visualized as the following:\n\nNote: The primary reason for rebasing is to maintain a linear project history. For example, consider a situation where the main branch has progressed since you started working on a feature branch. You want to get the latest updates to the main branch in your feature branch, but you want to keep your branch's history clean so it appears as if you've been working off the latest main branch. This gives the later benefit of a clean merge of your feature branch back into the main branch. Why do we want to maintain a \"clean history\"? The benefits of having a clean history become tangible when performing Git operations to investigate the introduction of a regression.\nIncorrect:\nNot B: git-merge - Join two or more development histories together.\nSquash merging is a merge option that allows you to condense the Git history of topic branches when you complete a pull request. Instead of each commit on the topic branch being added to the history of the default branch, a squash merge adds all the file changes to a single new commit on the default branch.\nNot D: git merge --allow-unrelated-histories\nBy default, git merge command refuses to merge histories that do not share a common ancestor. This option can be used to override this safety when merging histories of two projects that started their lives independently. As that is a very rare occasion, no configuration variable to enable this by default exists and will not be added.\nReference:\nhttps://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase",

Litware has a main office and five branch offices.\n\nExisting Environment -\n\nApplication Architecture -\nThe company's primary application is a single monolithic retirement fund management system based on ASP.NET web forms that use logic written in VB.NET.\nSome new sections of the application are written in C#.\nVariations of the application are created for individual customers. Currently, there are more than 80 live code branches in the application's code base.\nThe application was developed by using Microsoft Visual Studio. Source code is stored in Team Foundation Server (TFS) in the main office. The branch offices access the source code by using TFS proxy servers.\n\nArchitectural Issues -\nLitware focuses on writing new code for customers. No resources are provided to refactor or remove existing code. Changes to the code base take a long time, as dependencies are not obvious to individual developers.\nMerge operations of the code often take months and involve many developers. Code merging frequently introduces bugs that are difficult to locate and resolve.\nCustomers report that ownership costs of the retirement fund management system increase continually. The need to merge unrelated code makes even minor code changes expensive.\nCustomers report that bug reporting is overly complex.\n\nRequirements -\n\nPlanned Changes -\nLitware plans to develop a new suite of applications for investment planning. The investment planning applications will require only minor integration with the existing retirement fund management system.\nThe investment planning applications suite will include one multi-tier web application and two iOS mobile applications. One mobile application will be used by employees; the other will be used by customers.\nLitware plans to move to a more agile development methodology. Shared code will be extracted into a series of packages.\nLitware has started an internal cloud transformation process and plans to use cloud-based services whenever suitable.\nLitware wants to become proactive in detecting failures, rather than always waiting for customer bug reports.\n\nTechnical Requirements -\nThe company's investment planning applications suite must meet the following technical requirements:\nNew incoming connections through the firewall must be minimized.\nMembers of a group named Developers must be able to install packages.\nThe principle of least privilege must be used for all permission assignments.\nA branching strategy that supports developing new functionality in isolation must be used.\nMembers of a group named Team Leaders must be able to create new packages and edit the permissions of package feeds.\nVisual Studio App Center must be used to centralize the reporting of mobile application crashes and device types in use.\nBy default, all releases must remain available for 30 days, except for production releases, which must be kept for 60 days.\nCode quality and release quality are critical. During release, deployments must not proceed between stages if any active bugs are logged against the release.\nThe mobile applications must be able to call the share pricing service of the existing retirement fund management system. Until the system is upgraded, the service will only support basic authentication over HTTPS.\nThe required operating system configuration for the test servers changes weekly. Azure Automation State Configuration must be used to ensure that the operating system on each test server is configured the same way when the servers are created and checked periodically.\n\nCurrent Technical Issue -\nThe test servers are configured correctly when first deployed, but they experience configuration drift over time. Azure Automation State Configuration fails to correct the configurations.\nAzure Automation State Configuration nodes are registered by using the following command.\nQuestion\n\nTo resolve the current technical issue, what should you do to the Register-AzureRmAutomationDscNode command?",

Query metrics from tests on the build artifacts such as pass rate or code coverage and deploy only if they are within required thresholds.\nUse Quality Gates to integrate monitoring into your pre-deployment or post-deployment. This ensures that you are meeting the key health/performance metrics\n(KPIs) as your applications move from dev to production and any differences in the infrastructure environment or scale is not negatively impacting your KPIs.\nNote: Gates allow automatic collection of health signals from external services, and then promote the release when all the signals are successful at the same time or stop the deployment on timeout. Typically, gates are used in connection with incident management, problem management, change management, monitoring, and external approval systems.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/continuous-monitoring https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/release/approvals/gates?view=azure-devops",
